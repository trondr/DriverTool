Issues
------
There is an issue with an currently unknown HP driver or software creating and installing files into folder: C:\Windows\sysnative
	MSVCP140.dll
	VCRUNTIME140.dll
This might trip an cmd installations checking for this folder in the following manner: "If sysnative folder exists then assume 32 bit process and set "C:\Windows\sysnative" as location of the 64 bits cmd.exe to launch 64 bits process cmd."

This needs to be investigated further.
