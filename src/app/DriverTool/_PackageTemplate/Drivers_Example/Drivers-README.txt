Each driver is located in a sub folder in the Drivers folder
Each driver is installed in alphabetical order of the sub folder names
To change the install order, prefix each sub folder so that the prefix controls the required alphabetical order, example 010_*
A sub folder name starting with an underscode (_) is skipped during install. This disables the driver without deleting the containing folder.
